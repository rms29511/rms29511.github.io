			<p>Hey, this is Rand, Welcome to my Web Page! Here is a little bit about me, I am nineteen years old and a student at the University of Georgia. I am from Rome, Ga which is about 3 hours away from Athens. My hobbies are spending time with those I love or enjoy being with, traveling, school, and food.

		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
		<p>Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. Whether the final destination is reached by land, air, or water I enjoy it all. 
			I have traveled to a total of nine countries. Each of them have been a wonderful experience. My favorite trip was a school trip to Costa Rica in high school. Getting to see almost every part of Costa Rica and learn about many aspects of the country from a native really was an eye opening experience. I hope to continue my travels throughout life and continue to learn and appreciate all the differnet and interesting places this world has to offer us.

			<H3>Family</H3>
		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>My family is very important to me. My family is a little different than most. My parents divorced when I was young and are both remarried. So from that, I have quite a large immediate family consiting of my mom and dad, step-dad and step-mom, a fully sister, and a half-brother. My family has always been there for me and I am grateful for their love and kindess always.

			<H3>Friends</H3>
		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>My friends are also a very big part of my life. I try to make as many friends as possible whenever I can. I have many friends from when I was younger and in high school. The relationships I formed will last a lifetime. i have been fortunate enough to have the same opportunity of creating friendships here at the University of Georgia too. I am excited for what the future holds for me and my friends and that e could continue to make memories and grow our relationships.

		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left">
			<p>Education to me has always been very important. Not matter what grade or year I have been in school, I always strive to do my very best. I have spent thousands of hours 
			doing school work, and I do not regret any of it. I love learning, I have a passion for it. While doing school work may be no fun, I embrace learning and challenging myself to work hard. By examining the table below, I think I have proven my passion and drive for learning in school.
